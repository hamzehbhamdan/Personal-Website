## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Hamzeh! I recently graduated with honors from Harvard University, where I studied Computer Science and Statistics. My passion lies at the intersection of data science and artificial intelligence, where I strive to build impactful solutions that address real-world challenges.

I develop software applications that leverage artificial intelligence to solve complex problems, aiming to create tools that are both innovative and practical. I also engage in data-driven research projects that uncover insights into pressing issues.

Through this website, I aim to share my projects, insights, and the journey of applying AI and data science to make a meaningful difference.

## Senior Thesis

Title: Cross-Market Signals: Economic Spillovers Across Markets

Description: This thesis investigates the interconnectedness of the U.S. and Chinese stock markets, analyzing how macroeconomic factors from one country affect the equity returns of the other. Using statistical and machine learning models on the Jensen, Kelly, and Pedersen Global Factors dataset, the study finds strong spillover effects from the U.S. to China, but minimal effects in the reverse direction.
